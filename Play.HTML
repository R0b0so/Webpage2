       <h1> Basic rules of soccer</h1><br> <br><p>
        Soccer, or football as it is called in certain countries, is a game played between two teams, each with the same number of players. <br> <br>
    
        The team has one designated goalkeeper (often referred to as a goalie) and outfield players.
        <br> <br>
        The game is played on a field, with each team trying to score goals by kicking the ball into the other
        team's goal.
        <br> <br>
        The way to win is simple: Score more goals than the other team in a certain amount of time.</p> <br> <br><br> <p>Now that you know how the game works here are some more rules to educate you more about soccer:</p><ul>
        <li>The ball must cross the goal line to score.</li>
        <li>The team with the most goals wins.</li>
        <li>The goalie is the only player who can touch the ball with their hands.</li>
        <li>If the ball goes out of bounds, the team who didn't touch it last gets to throw or kick it back in.</li>
        <li>If a player commits a foul or offense, the other team gets a free kick.</li></ul>
        <br> <br><br> <h1>Fouls</h1>
